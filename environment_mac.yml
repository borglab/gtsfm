name: gtsfm-v1
channels:
  # The GTSFM mac environment closely follows the linux conda environment file, 
  # except for two noticeable differences: no CUDA support and no DEGENSAC support.
  #
  # for priority order, we prefer pytorch as the highest priority as it supplies
  # latest stable packages for numerous deep learning based methods. conda-forge
  # supplies higher versions of packages like opencv compared to the defaults
  # channel.
