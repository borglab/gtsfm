name: gtsfm-v1
channels:
  # The GTSFM Mac environment closely follows the Linux conda environment file,
  # except for two noticeable differences: no CUDA support and no DEGENSAC support.
  #
  # Regarding priority order: we prefer PyTorch as the highest-priority channel,
  # as it supplies the latest stable packages for numerous deep learning methods.
  # conda-forge provides higher versions of packages like OpenCV compared to the defaults channel.
  #
  # Note: this environment is tested on an M3 Ultra chip.
