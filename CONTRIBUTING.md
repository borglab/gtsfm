# Contributing to GTSFM

Contributions to GTSFM are welcome!  If you find a bug, please [open an issue](https://github.com/borglab/gtsfm/issues) describing the problem with steps to reproduce.  Better yet, if you figure out a fix, please open a pull request!

To open a pull request, here are some steps to get you started:

- [Fork the GTSFM repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo) and [clone to your machine](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository).

- Create a branch for your changes.
  - `$ git checkout -b <name of your branch>`

- Validate that your changes do not break any existing unit tests. CI (Github Actions) should also pass. We use `pytest`.
  - Run all unit tests: `$ pytest tests`
 
- Reformat your code using Python [black](https://github.com/psf/black), with `-l 120` for a max line length of 120. 
- Ensure static analysis with flake8 does not throw any errors:

- Please provide documentation for any new code your pull request provides.

- [Open a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) https://github.com/borglab/gtsfm/pulls from your branch.
  - Hint: having unit tests that validate your changes with your pull
    request will help to land your changes faster.

## SfM Variable Name Conventions
We use a specific naming convention for image/SfM data throughout the codebase:
- `i` for camera indices
- `j` for 3d point indices
- `k` for measurement indices

## Coordinate System Conventions

Code in GTSFM adheres to a strict set of conventions about how rigid body transformations are expressed in code (described [here](https://gtsam.org/gtsam.org/2020/06/28/gtsam-conventions.html)). A few examples are provided below:
- `wTi`: pose of the i'th camera in the world frame. If there is only a single camera, `wTc` is also acceptable.
- `wTi_list`: pose of the i'th camera in the world frame, for n cameras
- `w_i2Ui1`: a ray from camera i2 to camera i1, inside the world coordinate system. Mathematically, `w_i2Ui1 = wRi_list[i2].rotate(i2Ui1)`. Since `i2Ui1` is the unit-normalized translational component of the pose of camera i1 inside i2's frame, then intuitively this is the ray from i2 to i1.

We ask that contributors prefer GTSAM types wherever possible unless it's not already wrapped and is a lot of work to do so, or there are good advantages to using other types (like np arrays).

## Python Style
- **Auto-Formatting**:We format code with `black` and a maximum line length of 120 characters.
- **Type hints**: Function signatures should include type hints. Do not put type information in the docstring if it is redundant with the type hint.
- **Branch Logic**: Return early, don't nest.
- **f-strings**: Use f-strings as a default for regular strings, except when logging, where there is a specific logging format.
- Default arguments should never be mutable (these will lead to unexpected and strange behavior), `def foo(mylist = [])` is not ok
- Do not use a dictionary as an object -- use `NamedTuple` instead.
- **Docstrings Required**: Each function should be accompanied by a docstring. Docstrings should be added as [described here](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#383-functions-and-methods).
    - Docstrings should start with a one-line summary of the program terminated by a period.
    - Leave one blank line.
    - If the input or return arguments are not None, use the following syntax:
```python
def fetch_smalltable_rows(
    table_handle: smalltable.Table, keys: Sequence[Union[bytes, str]], require_all_keys: bool = False
) -> Mapping[bytes, Tuple[str]]:
    """Fetches rows from a Smalltable.

    Retrieves rows pertaining to the given keys from the Table instance
    represented by table_handle.  String keys will be UTF-8 encoded.

    Args:
        table_handle: An open smalltable.Table instance.
        keys: A sequence of strings representing the key of each table
          row to fetch.  String keys will be UTF-8 encoded.
        require_all_keys: Optional; If require_all_keys is True only
          rows with values set for all keys will be returned.

    Returns:
        A dict mapping keys to the corresponding table row data
        fetched. Each row is represented as a tuple of strings. For
        example:

        {b'Serak': ('Rigel VII', 'Preparer'),
         b'Zim': ('Irk', 'Invader'),
         b'Lrrr': ('Omicron Persei 8', 'Emperor')}

        Returned keys are always bytes.  If a key from the keys argument is
        missing from the dictionary, then that row was not found in the
        table (and require_all_keys must have been False).

    Raises:
        IOError: An error occurred accessing the smalltable.
    """
