Distributed Dask Cluster Test with PostgreSQL Integration and YAML Configuration

This module implements a toy test example for setting up and running a distributed Dask cluster
with the following components:
- Local Dask scheduler with dashboard
- Remote Dask workers connected via SSH tunnels
- PostgreSQL database integration for storing computation results
- YAML-based configuration management

Key Features:
- Automatic port conflict detection and resolution
- SSH tunnel establishment for secure remote worker communication
- Database initialization and result storage
- Configurable worker and scheduler settings via YAML

Architecture:
1. Local machine runs the Dask scheduler and PostgreSQL database
2. SSH tunnels are established to remote servers for secure communication
3. Remote workers connect to the local scheduler through the tunnels
4. Workers execute tasks and store results directly in the PostgreSQL database
5. All configuration is externalized to a YAML file for easy modification
