Georgia Tech Structure-from-Motion (GTSfM) is an end-to-end SfM pipeline based on [GTSAM](https://github.com/borglab/gtsam). GTSfM was designed from the ground-up to natively support parallel computation using [Dask](https://dask.org/).

## License

The majority of our code is governed by an MIT license and is suitable for commercial use. However, certain implementations featured in our repo (e.g., SuperPoint, SuperGlue) are governed by a non-commercial license and may not be used commercially.

## Installation

GTSfM requires no compilation, as Python wheels are provided for GTSAM. This repository includes external repositories as Git submodules –- don't forget to pull submodules with `git submodule update --init --recursive` or clone with `git clone --recursive https://github.com/borglab/gtsfm.git`.

To run GTSfM, first, we need to create a conda environment with the required dependencies.

On **Linux**, with CUDA support, run:

```bash
conda env create -f environment_linux.yml
conda activate gtsfm-v1 # you may need "source activate gtsfm-v1" depending upon your bash and conda set-up
```

On **macOS**, there is no CUDA support, so run:

```bash
conda env create -f environment_mac.yml
conda activate gtsfm-v1
```

Now, install `gtsfm` as a module:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Make sure that you can run `python -c "import gtsfm; import gtsam; print('hello world')"` in python, and you are good to go!

## Usage Guide (Running 3D Reconstruction)

Before running reconstruction, if you intend to use modules with pre-trained weights, such as SuperPoint, SuperGlue, or PatchmatchNet, please first run:

```bash
./download_model_weights.sh
```

To run SfM with a dataset with only an image directory and EXIF, with image file names ending with "jpg", please create the following file structure like

```
└── {DATASET_NAME}
       ├── images
               ├── image1.jpg
               ├── image2.jpg
               ├── image3.jpg
```

and run

```python
python gtsfm/runner/run_scene_optimizer_olssonloader.py --config_name {CONFIG_NAME} --dataset_root {DATASET_ROOT} --image_extension jpg --num_workers {NUM_WORKERS}
```

For example, if you had 4 cores available and wanted to use the Deep Front-End (recommended) on the "door" dataset, you should run:

```bash
python gtsfm/runner/run_scene_optimizer_olssonloader.py --dataset_root tests/data/set1_lund_door --image_extension JPG --config_name deep_front_end.yaml --num_workers 4
```

(or however many workers you desire).

You can view/monitor the distributed computation using the [Dask dashboard](http://localhost:8787/status).

Currently we require EXIF data embedded into your images (or you can provide ground truth intrinsics in the expected format for an Olsson dataset, or COLMAP-exported text data, etc.)

If you would like to compare GTSfM output with COLMAP output, please run:

```python
python gtsfm/runner/run_scene_optimizer_colmaploader.py --config_name {CONFIG_NAME} --images_dir {IMAGES_DIR} --colmap_files_dirpath {COLMAP_FILES_DIRPATH} --image_extension jpg --num_workers {NUM_WORKERS} --max_frame_lookahead {MAX_FRAME_LOOKAHEAD}
```

where `COLMAP_FILES_DIRPATH` is a directory where .txt files such as `cameras.txt`, `images.txt`, etc have been saved.

To visualize the result using Open3D, run:

```bash
python gtsfm/visualization/view_scene.py
```

For users that are working with the same dataset repeatedly, we provide functionality to cache front-end results for
GTSfM for very fast inference afterwards. For more information, please refer to [`gtsfm/frontend/cacher/README.md`](https://github.com/borglab/gtsfm/tree/master/gtsfm/frontend/cacher).

For users that want to run GTSfM on a cluster of multiple machines, we provide setup instructions here: [`CLUSTER.md`](https://github.com/borglab/gtsfm/tree/master/CLUSTER.md)

## Repository Structure

GTSfM is designed in an extremely modular way. Each module can be swapped out with a new one, as long as it implements the API of the module's abstract base class. The code is organized as follows:

- `gtsfm`: source code, organized as:
  - `averaging`
    - `rotation`: rotation averaging implementations ([Shonan](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02737), Chordal, etc)
    - `translation`: translation averaging implementations ([1d-SFM](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/projects/1dsfm/docs/1DSfM_ECCV14.pdf), etc)
  - `bundle`: bundle adjustment implementations
  - `common`: basic classes used through GTSFM, such as `Keypoints`, `Image`, `SfmTrack2d`, etc
  - `data_association`: 3d point triangulation (DLT) w/ or w/o RANSAC, from 2d point-tracks
  - `densify`
  - `frontend`: SfM front-end code, including:
    - `detector`: keypoint detector implementations (DoG, etc)
    - `descriptor`: feature descriptor implementations ([SIFT](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~lowe/papers/ijcv04.pdf), [SuperPoint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.07629) etc)
    - `matcher`: descriptor matching implementations ([Superglue](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11763), etc)
    - `verifier`: 2d-correspondence verifier implementations ([Degensac](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.466.2719&rep=rep1&type=pdf), OA-Net, etc)
    - `cacher`: Cache implementations for different stages of the front-end.
  - `loader`: image data loaders
  - `utils`: utility functions such as serialization routines and pose comparisons, etc
- `tests`: unit tests on every function and module

## Compiling Additional Verifiers

On Linux, we have made `pycolmap`'s LORANSAC available in [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/pycolmap/). However, on Mac, `pycolmap` must be built from scratch. See the instructions [here](https://github.com/borglab/gtsfm/blob/master/gtsfm/frontend/verifier/loransac.py#L10).
