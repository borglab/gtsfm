        Detect the features in an image

        Coordinate system convention:
        1. The x coordinate denotes the horizontal dfirection (+ve direction towards the right)
        2. The y coordinate denotes the vertical direction (+ve direction downwards)
        3. Origin is at the top left corner of the image

        Output format:
        1. The first two columns are the x and y coordinate respectively. They are compulsory.
        2. The third optional column contains the scale information of the features.
        3. Any extra column might not be considered downstream
        4. If applicable, the keypoints should be sorted in decreasing order of score/confidence

        Arguments:
            image (Image): the input RGB image as a 3D numpy array

            features (np.ndarray[float]): detected features as a numpy array
