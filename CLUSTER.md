# GTSFM on CLUSTER

### How to Run GTSfM on a Cluster?

GTSfM uses [SSHCluster](https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/deploying-ssh.html#dask.distributed.SSHCluster) module of [Dask.distributed](https://distributed.dask.org/en/stable/) library to allow utilizing clusters for GTSfM runs. This is a step-by-step guide on how to set up your machines for a successful run on a cluster.

1. Enable passwordless SSH between all the workers on the cluster
    - Log in into a machine
    - For each of the other workers on the cluster run
        * ssh-copy-id
        * username@machine_ip_address_of_another_worker
        * Repeat the above two steps on all machines
    - Note machines should be able to ssh into themselves passwordless e.g. host1 should be able to ssh into host1.
2. Clone gtsfm and follow the main readme file to setup the environment on all nodes in the cluster at an identical path
3. Log into scheduler again and download the data to scheduler machine
4. Create a config file listing the cluster workers (example in [gtsfm/configs/cluster.yaml](https://github.com/borglab/gtsfm/blob/master/gtsfm/configs/cluster.yaml))
5. Run gtsfm with â€“cluster_config flag enabled, for example
    - ```
      python /home/username/gtsfm/gtsfm/runner run_scene_optimizer_colmaploader.py --images_dir /home/username/gtsfm/skydio-32/images/ --config_name sift_front_end.yaml --colmap_files_dirpath /home/hstepanyan3/gtsfm/skydio-32/colmap_crane_mast_32imgs/ --cluster_config cluster.yaml
      ```
    - Note that first worker in the cluster.yaml file is the scheduler machine that has the data
    - Always provide absolute paths for all directories
6. If you would like to check out the dask dashboard, you will need to do port forwarding from machine to your local computer:
    - ```
      ssh -N -f -L localhost:local_port:localhost:machine_port username@machine_adress
      ```

7. If you would like to download results from machines to local computer run:
    - ```
      scp -r username@host:machine/results/path /local/computer/directory
      ```
